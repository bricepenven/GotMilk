+instead of Recommended Mob = Milk Mob, in Moderation panel - all media. Same style as thumbnail / preview but we should also be able to change the status manually from Approved to Rejected and vice versa in case someone made an error on the initial review. Same metadata as well.

+I still see recommended mob instead of Milk Mob when previewing a media. In moderation panel, the drop down menu should only be available for mob if there's no mobs, otherwise we should be able to edit the field to change it if needed.

+in moderation when previewing a media, the dropdown menu for milk mob is still present even tho there's a milk mob already. I should only be able to edit it if there's a milk mob already. Drop down should show up if there's none. Also in the same tab, rename recommended mob to milk mob.

+DUDE. IN MODERATE TAB, WHEN OPENING A MEDIA IF THAT MEDIA ALREADY HAVE A MILK MOB, YOU SHOULDN'T SHOW ME THE DROP DOWN MENU TO CHANGE IT, YOU SHOULD SHOW A PEN TO ENTER EDIT MODE TO CHANGE IT. BUT IF THERE'S ANY THEN YES YOU CHANGE IT. IF WE REJECT A MEDIA NO MILK MOB SHOULD BE PRESENT.

+ok you dont understand asshole. If my media already have a mob assign, you should only allow me to edit it and save it, you shouldn;t show me the drop down menu of the mobs. However, if there's any mob assigned that's fine, but there's no saved button, so right now, its not saving.
